The following steps are followed for ICP-9:

In Jupiter notepad written the code for the following and mentioned the comments for the code and uploaded the "NNDL-ICP-9.ipynb" to repo:

 - First installed the packages Keras and Tensorflow.
 - Programming elements: 1. Basics of LSTM 2. Types of RNN 3. Use case: Sentiment Analysis on the Twitter data set 
 - In the programming:
 - Save the model and use the saved model to predict on new text data (ex, “A lot of good things are happening. We are respected again throughout the world, and that's a great thing.@realDonaldTrump”)
 - Apply GridSearchCV on the source code provided in the class 

In the "Neural Networks & DL Assignment_9 Screenshots & Github link.pdf" file consists of screenshots of the resultant compiled code and Github link to the repository.

In the Video Link consists of Video regarding the technical explanation of the code.
